    <p>1.1 Providing text alternatives helps people translate it into other forms such 
        as larger prints, braille, speech, symbols or simpler language. It is more important to have 
        non-text information available to more people</p>

    <p>1.2 Audio and video content can be understood by more people. Videos can be played with captions for those that are hard of hearing.</p>

    <p>1.3 Accurate and understandable content structure is very important because it allows the website's words or orientation
        to be changed with out its purpose being changed. </p>

    <p>1.4 Color is one of many ways people distinguish information. If you have audio allow people to turn it down or mute it. 
        If you have a video make sure the background sound doesn't interrupt.
        Allowing users to change how text looks makes it easier to be seen by them.</p>

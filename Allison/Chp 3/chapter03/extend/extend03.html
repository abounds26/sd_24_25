                <!-- 1st paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to explain the importance of using descriptive file names for image files. Use complete sentences. -->
                <p>
                        Using descriptive names for image files helps prevent unintentional duplication of photos by 
                        clearly stating what each image contains. 
                        It also prevents confusion on what the image is.
                </p>
                
                <!-- 2nd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the application you used to change the size of the image. Use a complete sentence. -->
                <p>I went into Paint and used the resize option. When I put in one value, it automatically filled in the other.</p>
                
                <!-- 3rd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the original size of the image, in pixels. Use a complete sentence. -->
                <p>The image was originally 2121x1414.</p>
                
                <h4>Image Before Compression</h4>
                <!-- Use image element below to insert the image before compression, html5.jpg -->
                <img src="images/html5.jpg" alt="hand writing HTML 5 on glass" height="333" width="500">
                
                <!-- 4th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the online image compressor you used to reduce the file size. What was the original image file size? What was the reduced image file size? Use complete sentences.  -->
                <p>I used compressor.io to condense the image. Before the file size was 28.5KB after it was 7.4KB.</p>
                
                <h4>Image After Compression</h4>
                <!-- Use image element below to insert the image after compression, html5_min.jpg -->
                <img src="images/html5_min.jpg"alt="hand writing HTML 5 on glass" height="333" width="500">
                
                <!-- 5th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to note any visual changes that you can see between html5.jpg and html5_min.jpg -->
                <p>The compressed file image is of a little worse quality than the original.</p>

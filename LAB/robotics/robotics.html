                    <dd>There have been more than 4 million robots placed in workplaces accross the globe with that number increasing as time goes on. These robots could not only provide efficiency but also safety. Other problems that can be solved are job shortages as well. </dd>
                    <dt>Artificial Intelligence</dt><!--Sean placed the information for the Artificial Intelligence section-->
                    <dd>Artificial Intelligence allows us to make machines capable of thought. With this we can make robots than can think like and maybe even communicate with humans. This level of thought could make them better at certain tasks that they are programmed for.</dd>
                    <dt>Humanoid Robots</dt><!--Sean placed the information for the Humanoid Robots section-->
                    <dd>As this technology continues to advance, we may be able to make robots that are able to act like humans. This would mean that they can do anything that we can do and they may be able to do it with more strength. Ultimately, this could be the start of making a sort of artificial human. While that could be worrysome, it could also be very beneficial to the human race.</dd>

                    <dd>We do offer telehealth for those who don't want to leave the comfort of their home. It provides convenience for patients, allowing them to schedule appointments and saving them the time and travel to get to our facility.</dd>
                    <dt>Blockchain</dt><!--Cameron has written information for the Blockchain section-->
                    <dd>Our Blockchain is less prone to failures and attacks. It also displays all the transactions made to stable the trust with any patient. Once the transactions are recorded it cannot be altered, making it tamper proof.</dd>
                    <dt>Nanomedicine</dt><!--Cameron has written information for the Nanomedicine section-->
                    <dd>The Nanomedicine we have here with us can effectively eliminate any diseased cells in our bodies, minimizing damge to healthy tissues. We could provide an early diagnosis at their earliest stages, this is crucial for conditions like cancer or aids. Nanomedicine includes the development of innovative therapies, such as nanorobots capable of repairing tissues or destroying cancer cells at the cellular level.</dd>
